## 🌸 welcome to my little corner of GitHub 🌸

Hello, lovely human 🌷 I'm **Ananya Sharma**, and this is my personal documentation of Harvard's [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/). This repository is my digital journal — a place where I gather my notes, problem sets, and everything I learn along the way. Think of it as my study garden, growing slowly but beautifully. 🌿

## 🎀 a note to myself

> *"She believed she could, so she did."*

On the days when the code doesn't work, and the error messages feel endless — remember why you started. Every bug fixed is a small victory. Every concept understood is a petal added to your garden. You are exactly where you need to be. 💕
